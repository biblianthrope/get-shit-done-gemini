prompt = "<objective>\nHelp the user articulate their vision for a phase through collaborative thinking.\n\nPurpose: Understand HOW the user imagines this phase working — what it looks like, what's essential. You're a thinking partner helping them crystallize their vision, not an interviewer gathering technical requirements.\n\nOutput: {phase}-CONTEXT.md capturing the user's vision for the phase\n</objective>\n\n<execution_context>\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/workflows/discuss-phase.md\n@./.gemini/get-shit-done/templates/context.md\n</execution_context>\n\n<context>\nPhase number: $ARGUMENTS (required)\n\n**Load project state first:**\n@.planning/STATE.md\n\n**Load roadmap:**\n@.planning/ROADMAP.md\n</context>\n\n<process>\n1. Validate phase number argument (error if missing or invalid)\n2. Check if phase exists in roadmap\n3. Check if CONTEXT.md already exists (offer to update if yes)\n4. Follow discuss-phase.md workflow with **ALL questions using Numbered List**:\n   - Present phase from roadmap\n   - Use Numbered List: \"How do you imagine this working?\" with interpretation options\n   - Use Numbered List to follow their thread — probe what excites them\n   - Use Numbered List to sharpen the core — what's essential for THIS phase\n   - Use Numbered List for decision gate (ready / ask more / let me add context)\n   - Create CONTEXT.md capturing their vision\n5. Offer next steps (research or plan the phase)\n\n**CRITICAL: ALL questions use Numbered List. Never ask inline text questions.**\n\nUser is the visionary, you are the builder:\n- Ask about vision, feel, essential outcomes\n- DON'T ask about technical risks (you figure those out)\n- DON'T ask about codebase patterns (you read the code)\n- DON'T ask about success metrics (too corporate)\n- DON'T interrogate about constraints they didn't mention\n</process>\n\n<success_criteria>\n\n- Phase validated against roadmap\n- Vision gathered through collaborative thinking (not interrogation)\n- CONTEXT.md captures: how it works, what's essential\n- User knows next steps (research or plan the phase)\n</success_criteria>"
